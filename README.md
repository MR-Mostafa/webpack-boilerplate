## Auto Creation of HTML files:
We will be using `html-webpack-plugin` for creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. To use this plugin:
- Open the `webpack.config.js` and add the following code to `config.plugins` (on line 147)
- You need to change the values of <strong>template</strong> and <strong>filename</strong>. The rest of the values are created automatically and do not need to be changed in most cases
```js
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    template: './src/layouts/index.html',
    filename: 'index.html',
    inject: mode  === 'production' ? false : true,
    chunks: mode  === 'production' ? [] : true,
    excludeChunks: excludeChunks,
    mode: mode,
    staticFile: staticFile,
}),
```

## Other options:
- <strong>RemoveFileAfterBuild</strong> (on line 16)
     * This variable represents the file name in './src/js' that remove after build.
     * With this feature you can delete unnecessary files.
     * this feature works in only 'production' mode
     * e.g: `const RemoveFileAfterBuild = ['file1.js', 'file2.js'];`
     
- <strong>copyStaticFile</strong> (on line 28)
    * If you want to copy a file (files) without changing it during of the build, You must complete this variable.
    * These files are copied to the build folder
    * e.g: 
        ```js
        const copyStaticFile = [
            { from: './src/js/script.js', to: './js/script.js' },
            { from: './src/css/style.css', to: './css/style.css' },
            { from: './src/LICENSE.txt', to: './LICENSE.txt' },
        ];
        ```
        
- <strong>entry</strong> (on line 38)
    * entry webpack (The point or points where to start the application bundling process.)
    * e.g:
        ```js
        const entry = {
            index: './src/js/entry/index.js',
            single: './src/js/entry/single.js',
        };
        ```
        
<strong>Note:</strong> This bundler does not config for react or vue.
